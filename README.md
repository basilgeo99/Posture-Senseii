An ARDUINO based and bluetooth enabled IOT project.

# What is it?
Posture Senseii is a IOT health tool that detects and monitors a person's posture.

Using this data, it determines whether a person is maintaining a proper posture for medical health maintainability.

If, at any point, the posture is detected to be wrong then the device alerts the user in the following ways : 
+ Visual alert in the form of red LED
+ Audio alert in the form of a beep by the buzzer.
+ Notification alerts on the phone.

Additionally the user can, at any time, access the Dabble application on his/her phone and view real-time values are acquired by the monitor.
